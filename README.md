# HD2S
[Video Saliency Detection with Domain Adaption using Hierarchical Gradient Reversal Layers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01220)
## Notes

- The code for train and test is an adapted version of the original available [here](https://github.com/MichiganCOG/TASED-Net).

- As Feature Extractor, HD2S employs S3D pretained on Kinetics-400 dataset. The S3D weights can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/kylemin/S3D).

- The whole HD2S weights trained on [DHF1K](https://mmcheng.net/videosal/) dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://studentiunict-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/uni307680_studium_unict_it/EVyDIERfwcdOnAF84v1b1VQBlDNxxhOdI-nAIafqwVV7Lg?download=1)
